#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/BQKpbVzFBAU
#### Description:

This a web-app, it shows the different events, activities and places filter by a multiple categories of interest 
and also by a price range, you have also the possibility to crate your own events and to find a group of persons who 
want to go to a specific place and join them. 

It is developed on Flask, HTML, CSS and JS.

The application offers in a simple interface a list and / or map of activities where the user, through certain filters and personalized suggestions, can both find, group, sequence, save and create events of interest.

This application public target is : For an audience between 18 and 30, who are actively interested in profitably investing their free time for personal development and improvement of the quality of life, as well as to practice "networking" and create communities.

Both from my own experience and from the testimonies of initially more than 50 people of different geographical origins, it is known that it is a necessity and that it would also indirectly solve problems of depression and isolation.

Current solutions to human-human connectivity are very scattered or focus only on the digital realm of social development. It is worth offering a joint solution adapted to the personality of each user, helping to build ties and solid social activities under a tool that facilitates the search for them.
