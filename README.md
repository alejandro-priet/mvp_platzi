# Events searcher
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/BQKpbVzFBAU
#### Description:

This a web-app, it shows the different events, activities and places filter by a multiple categories of interest 
and also by a price range, you have also the possibility to crate your own events and to find a group of persons who 
want to go to a specific place and join them. 

It is developed on Flask, HTML, CSS and JS.

The application offers in a simple interface a list and / or map of activities where the user, through certain filters and personalized suggestions, can both find, group, sequence, save and create events of interest.

This application public target is : For an audience between 18 and 30, who are actively interested in profitably investing their free time for personal development and improvement of the quality of life, as well as to practice "networking" and create communities.

Both from my own experience and from the testimonies of initially more than 50 people of different geographical origins, it is known that it is a necessity and that it would also indirectly solve problems of depression and isolation.

Current solutions to human-human connectivity are very scattered or focus only on the digital realm of social development. It is worth offering a joint solution adapted to the personality of each user, helping to build ties and solid social activities under a tool that facilitates the search for them.

Here is te description of the detailed caracteristics and future iumprovements:

All the characteristics that are too complex for the development of the MVP will be worked from the design to generate the illusion of an approximate interaction to the true operation.

- Design a summarized interface on the screens [Home (map) | Explore | Inbox (notifications and messages) | Profile] that always represents the feeling of being able to be used quickly and easily.
- Bottom persistent navigation bar [Home (map) | Explore | Inbox (notifications and messages) | Profile ]
- Design a user interface that allows the person to obtain a result of their search in maximum 4 steps (excluding the adjustment of filters and complex tasks)
- Design a panel of results or icons on the map with which the user interacts and manages to group, sequence, select, exclude, add ... these events to save them, export them to Google Maps as a route and / or share them.
- Log In screen
- Profile screen:
    - Photo or avatar (to be defined)
    - Name or nickname
    - Configure profile: likes, blocks, etc.
    - Saved tags
    - Upcoming events or activities || own or external
- Develop:
    - Neural network that receives the likes of an x number of anonymous users, their preferred activities, likes and history of visits or creations and provides a compatibility matrix between categories, age, sex, ... and places, activities, events.
    - Connectivity with an API (to be decided. Provisionally: google maps) that allows obtaining the geographical data of the sites of interest, rating, frequency of visits and estimated prices to spend. Relate the result of the neural network with those places together with simple filters of Neural network, time and time availability.
    - Implement interactions on the Map and in Explore as:
        - Save search results, plans, groups of places, groups of events, order of visit.
        - Side drop-down menu to adjust filters (Budget, Distance in a radius, Duration, Schedule, Category, Change location, Type of event or place)
    - LogIn screen (Google, email, .... to be defined)
    - Crypto payment system
    - To define:
        - Tradable: NFT, Discounts such as NFT, Rewards for attendance or creation of events in Crypto or NFT, Gifts ...
        - Trading system for Premium users (NFT, Gifts etc ..)
        - Creation of events of more than 10 people for premium users
        - Referral system
        - Create own tradable (NFT, ...)
